* **Trigger:** bending of index finger.
* **Thumb press:** touching of middle segment of index finger by thumb.
* **Opisthenar touch:** tounching of opisthenar by index finger of opposite hand.
* **Palm touch:** touching of palm by index finger of opposite hand.
* **Thumb touch:** touching of thumb finger by index finger of opposite hand.

## Notes
Currently there is a strange behaviour of tracking problems that affect AMD and few Intel systems. If you're encountering with tracking problems, it's adviced to choose different release with higher `vs####`, or build driver on your system. Refer to **Building** section below.

## Building (for developers)
* Clone repository with `git`:
```
git clone https://github.com/SDraw/driver_leap.git
```
* Initialize submodules:
```
cd driver_leap
git submodule update --init --depth=1
```
* Open `driver_leap.sln` solution in Visual Studio (2013 and up)
* Build your platform:
  * x64 - build output is in `bin/win64`
* Copy build files to `<SteamVR_folder>/drivers/leap/bin/win64`:
  * `driver_leap.dll`
  * `leap_monitor.exe`  
  **Note:** There are post-build events for projects to copy build files directly to SteamVR driver folder that can be enabled manually.
* Copy additional shared libraries to `<SteamVR_folder>/drivers/leap/bin/win64`:
  * `vendor/LeapSDK/bin/x64/LeapC.dll`
  * `vendor/openvr/bin/win64/openvr_api.dll`
* Copy `resources` folder from solution root to `<SteamVR_folder>/drivers/leap`. 
* Copy `driver.vrdrivermanifest` file from solution root to `<SteamVR_folder>/drivers/leap`.
